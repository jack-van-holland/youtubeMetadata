# youtubeMetadata
A database and query interface for YouTube video and comment metadata. 
Downloaded some random and most popular video and comment metadatafrom 2020 with the YouTube API for the database. Designed relational database schema and created database to hold the metadata. Additionally, developed an interface to allow user to query the database without any programming by simply filling in checkboxes, text boxes, etc. Wrote a series of SQL procedures to interact with the webpage and actually perform the requested queries. The webpage itself is somewhat unpolished; the focus was on creating a interface where complex and flexible queries could be performed, such as filtering and correlations between data. The database is not maintained so cannot be sampled through my student website.  

Developed by Jack Van Holland and Soo-yeon Kim for Databases at JHU.
